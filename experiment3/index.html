				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>An ancient dungeon in the desert with blue and purple walls, the dungeon is randomly filled with shelters (houses) and the treasure chests.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>"-" represents the dirt in the background, "." represents the dungeon rooms and hallways. Wall tiles are automatically placed around the ".". The "1" in the dungeon represents a shelter (house) and the "2" represents a treasure chest.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This assignment was a huge challenge for me and I spent a lot of time getting autotiling to work. Another thing is that I found out that making random backgrounds and random animations was harder than I thought, I tried for a long time and still couldn't find a way to do it in the end I gave up. In this assignment I also learned how to properly use chatGPT when coding. i've found that when I have absolutely no idea how a function works and don't know where to start, chatGPT gives me a great starting point.</p>
