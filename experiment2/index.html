				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this project I'll use p5.js to create a generated image for this photo.</p>
				<div class="image-wrapper">

				<p>This is the photo I took in Lake Tahoe.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Relation to inspring image:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Color: The sky, lake, and background mountain colors were sampled from the image using the Photoshop eyedropper tool.</li>
					<li>Primitives: The stars and waves are rendered with ellipse primitives.</li>
					<li>Polygons: The mountain is a polygon using Perlin noise generation.</li>
					<li>Composition: Different random seed values lead to different shapes of mountains and different stars.</li>
					<li>Life: The waves are animated and the direction of the waves can be manipulated with the mouse cursor.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Experiment 2 went pretty smoothly, mainly because there are very good tutorials online for the effects I wanted to do, such as the gradient color background. The one I felt I had a hard time with was making random mountains using perlin noise, which took me quite a bit of time.</p>
